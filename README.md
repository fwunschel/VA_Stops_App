# VA_Stops_App
Version 1.0 of the statewide Virginia Stops app, utilizing data located
[here](https://data.virginia.gov/stories/s/Virginia-Community-Policing-Act-Data-Collection/rden-cz3h/)

Statewide traffic stop data can also be accessed [here](https://www.albemarle.org/government/police/virginia-community-policing-act-data/-folder-1770-3077#docan3077_4195_2473)

An operizationalized early verson of this RShiny app was produced before the state created their own dashboard so community advocates and members of the general public could better understand the state of traffic stops statewide and in their own specific county.
